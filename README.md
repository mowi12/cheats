# ðŸ§  Custom Arsenal Cheat Sheets

This repository contains a collection of custom cheat sheets for quick reference and command recall. It serves as a centralized resource for used commands, organized in a way that makes them easy to access and integrate into your workflow.

## How to Add New Commands Can Be Added

New custom commands can be easily added to the cheat sheet collection by following these steps:

### 1. Creating a New File

- A new Markdown (`.md`) or reStructuredText (`.rst`) file should be created in root directory.
- The file should be named descriptively (e.g., `git_commands.md`)

### 2. Adding Commands

- Commands can be added within the file, using appropriate formatting. Descriptions, arguments, and examples can be included for each command.

- Example in Markdown format:
  ```md
  # Git Commands

  ## Clone a Repository
  `git clone <repository_url>`
  - **Description**: Clones a repository from a given URL.
  - **Example**: `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git`
  ```
